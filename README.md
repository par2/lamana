#LamAna

An extensible Python package for Laminate Analysis.

###Installation

There are two simple options for installation.  The first option "works" assuming the local dependencies do not break the current package API.  The second option is reproducibly safe and installs versions of pinned dependencies that have been tested.  Try this second option in case of bugs, yet be cautioned that this second option may downgrade some local pip packages (see affected dependencies in requirements.txt).

Assuming Python 2.7.6+ or Python 3.3+ is installed, open a terminal and run one of the following:

`pip install lamana                         # option 1`

`pip install lamana -r requirements.txt     # option 2`
