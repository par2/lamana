# LamAna

An extensible Python package for laminate analysis

## Installation

The recommended option for installing a reproducibly-safe package is simply:

    $ pip install lamana -r requirements.txt

*NOTE: this option installs a source distribution using "pinned" dependencies, which may upgrade/downgrade existing packages in your local environment.  See the documentation for more details and alternative installation options.*
