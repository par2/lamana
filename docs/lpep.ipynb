    "This LPEP preserves best practices, standards or customs for develpopers that maintain code consistency.  Tne following micro-PEPs are numerically assigned.  New micro-PEPs will be added over time or modified with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A *General Convention* will be standardized for internal code, such that the inner layer(s) is/are consistently returned as a list of floats i.e. `400-[200]-800` and `400-[100-100]-800`.  This format is used to maintain type checking consistency within the code.  External use by the user input is not bound by this restriction however; shorthand notation is fine too, e.g. `400-200-800`.  Such notation will be internally converted to the General Convention.\n",
    "2. Except for user values such as layer thicknesses and total calculations (microns, um), all other internal, dimensional variables will assume SI units (i.e. meters, m).  These values will be converted for convenience for the user in the DataFrames, (e.g. millimeters, mm).  This PEP is adopted to limit excessive unit conversions within code.\n",
    "3. Per PEP 8, semi-private variables are marked with a single preceding underscore, i.e. `_check_layer_order()`.  This style is used to visually indicate internal methods/attributes, not particularly important for the user. Double underscores will only be used (sparingly) to prevent name collisions.  Internal hook methods with use both trailing and leading underscores, e.g. `_use_model_`.\n",
    "4. The true lamina thickness value (`t_`) will remain constant in the DataFrame and not vary with height (`d_`).\n",
    "5. In general, use convenient naming conventions that indicate modules where the objects originates, e.g. `FeatureInput` object. However, whenever possible, aim to use descriptive names that reduce confusion over convienient names, e.g. `LaminateModel` object instead of `ConstructsTheories` object.\n",
    "6. For compatibilty checks, run nose 2.x and nose 3.x before commits to target Py3to2 errors in tests, (e.g. `dict.values()`).\n",
    "7. Materials parameters are handled internally as a dict formatted in *Standard Form* (compatible with pandas DataFrames) , but it is displayed as a DataFrame when the materials attribute is called by the user.  The Standard form comprises a dict of materials property dicts. By contrast, a *Quick Form* is allowed as input by the user, but interally converted to the Standard Form.  \n",

    "    - Standard Form: \n",
    "    `{'Modulus': {'Mat1': value,...},'Poissons': {'Mat1': value, ...}`\n",
    "8. Internally, middle layers from `Geometry` return the full thickness, not the symmetric thickness.\n",
    "9. Thicknesses will be handled this way.  \n",
    "    - $t$ is the total laminate thickness\n",
    "    - $t_k$ is the thickess at lamina `k`\n",
    "    - `t_` is the internal variable that refers to true lamina thicknesses.\n",
    "    - The DataFrame column label $t(um)$ will refer to lamina thicknesses.\n",
    "    - `h_` is also a lamina thickness, relative to the neutral axis; therefore middle layers (and `h_`) are symmeric about the neutral axis $t_{middle} = 2h_{middle}$\n",
    "10. p=2 give the most critical points to calculate - interfacial minima and maxima per layer.  Maxima correlate with the 'interface' `label_` and minima correspond to the 'discont.' `label_`.  However, at minimun it is importannt to test with p>=5 to calculate all point types (interfacial, internals and neutural axes) perferably for odd plies.\n",
    "11. in geometry strings, the dash character `-` separates layer types outer-inner-middle.  The comma `,` separates other things, such as similar layer types, such as inner_i -[200,100,300]-.  The following is an invalid geomtry string `'400-[200-100-300]-800'`.\n",
    "12. Two main branches will be maintained: \"master\" and \"stable\". \"master\" will reflect development versions, always ahead of stable releases.  \"stable\" will remain relatively unchanged except for minor point releases to fix bugs. \n",
    "13. This package will adopt [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n",
    "    >- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,\n",
    "    >- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and\n",
    "    >- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.\n",
    "14. Package releases pin dependencies to prevent breakage due to dependency patches/updates.

    "##LPEP 002:  Extending `Cases` with Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Status: Draft**\n",
    "- **Type: Process**\n",
    "- **Date: October 01, 2015**\n",
    "- **Current Version: 0.4.4b**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As of 0.4.4b, a `Cases` object supports a group of cases distinguished by  different ps where each case is a set of LaminateModels with some pattern that relates them.  For example, an interesting plot might show multiple geometries of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pattern A: constant total thickness\n",
    "- Pattern B: constant midddle thickness\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, two cases are represented, each comprising LaminateModels with geometries satisfying a specific pattern.  Currently `Cases` does not support groups of cases distinguished by pattern, but refactoring it thusly should be simple and will be discussed here.  Our goal is to extend the `Cases` class to generate cases that differ by parameters other than `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Desired Ouptut\n",
    "\n",
    "To plot both patterns together, we need to feed each case seperately to plotting functons.  We need to think of what may differ between cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- p\n",
    "- loading parameters\n",
    "- material properties\n",
    "- different geometries, similar plies \n",
    "- number plies (complex to plot simulataneously)\n",
    "- orientation (not implemented yet)\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the present conditions, the most simple pattern is determined by geometry.  Here are examples of cases to plot with particular patterns of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Pattern A: Constant Total Thickness\n",
    "case1.LMs = [<LamAna LaminateModel object (400-200-800) p=5>,\n",
    "             <LamAna LaminateModel object (350-400-500) p=5>,\n",
    "             <LamAna LaminateModel object (200-100-1400) p=5>,\n",
    "            ]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pattern B: Constant Middle and Total Thickness\n",
    "case2.LMs = [<LamAna LaminateModel object (400-200-800) p=5>,\n",
    "             <LamAna LaminateModel object (300-300-800) p=5>,\n",
    "             <LamAna LaminateModel object (200-400-800) p=5>,\n",
    "            ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "To encapsulate these patterns, we can manually create a dict of keys and case values.  Here the keys label each case by the pattern name, which aids in tracking what the cases do.  The `Cases` dict should emulate this modification to support labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cases = {'t_total': case1,\n",
    "         'mid&t_total': case2,}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Cases` would first have to support building different cases given groups of different geometry strings.  Perhaps given a dict of geometry strings, the latter object gets automatically created. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "patterns = {\n",
    "    't_total': ['400-200-800', '350-400-500', '200-100-1400'],\n",
    "    'mid&t_total': ['400-200-800', '300-300-800', '200-400-800'],\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The question then would be, how to label different ps or combine patterns i.e., t_total and ps.  Advanced `Cases` creation is a project for another time.  Meanwhile, this idea of plotting by dicts of this manner will be beta tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objective: organize patterns of interest and plot them easily with `Case` and `Cases` plot methods.\n",
    "    - Refactor Case and Cases to handle dicts in for the first arg.\n",
    "    - Parse keys to serve as label names (priority). \n",
    "    - Iterate the dict items to detect groups by the comma and generate a caselets for cases, which get plotted as subplots using an instanace of `output_.PanelPlot'\n",

    "## LPEP 003:  A humble case for `caselets`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Status: Accepted**\n",
    "- **Type: Process**\n",
    "- **Date: October 05, 2015**\n",
    "- **Current Version: 0.4.4b**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "By the final implementation of 0.4.4b, each case will generate a plot based on laminate data given loading, material and geometric information. Single plots are created, but subplots are desired also, where data can be compared from  different cases in a single figure.  This proposal suggests methods for achieving such plots by defining a new case-related term - a `caselet` - and its application to a figure object comprising subplots, termed `PanelPlot`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LaminateModel** (LM): an object that combines physical laminate dimensions and laminate theory data, currently in the form of DataFrames.\n",
    "- **case**: a group of LMs; an analytical unit typically sharing similar loading, material and geometric parameters.  The final outcome is commonly represented by a matplotlib axes.\n",
    "- **cases**: a group of cases each differentiated by some \"pattern\" of interest, e.g. p, geometries, etc. (see LPEP 002).\n",
    "- **caselet**: (new) a sub-unit of a case or cases object.  Forms are either a single geometry string, list of geometry strings or list of cases. The final outcome is commonly represented as a matplotlib axes, or subplot component (not an instance or class).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Containing Caselets\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation of caselets as matplotlib subplots requires us to pass objects into `Case` or `Cases`. To pass in caselets, a container must be used (e.g. list or dict) to encapsulate the objects.  Here this type of caselet could be a string, list or case.  If a list is used, there are at least three options for containing caselets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A list of geometry strings: `type(caselet) == str`\n",
    "1. A nested list of geometry strings: `type(caselet) == list`\n",
    "1. A list of cases: `type(caselet) == <LamAna.distributions.Case object>`\n",
    "\n",
    "If a dict is used to contain caselets, the latter options can substitute as dict values.  The keys can be either integers or explict labels.  *NOTE: a List of caselets will be implemented in 0.4.5.  Dict of caselets may or may not be implemented in future versions.*\n",

    "## LPEP 004:  Refactoring class `Stack`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Status: Draft**\n",
    "- **Type: Process**\n",
    "- **Date: October 20, 2015**\n",
    "- **Current Version: 0.4.4b1**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "    \n",
    "Inspired to adhere to classic data structures, we attempt to refactor some classes.  The present `constructs.Stack` class is not a true stack.  Athough built in a LIFO style, there are no methods for reversing the stack. It may be beneficial to the user to add or delete layers on the fly.  Stacks, queues and other data structures have methods for such manipulations.  Here are some ideas that entertain this train of thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insert and remove any layers\n",
    "- Access geometry positions in an index way\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> LM = la.distributions.Cases('400-200-800').LMs\n",
    ">>> LM.insert('-[-,100]-')\n",
    ">>> print(LM.geometry, LM.nplies)\n",
    "<Geometry object (400-[200,100]-800)>, 7\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> LM.remove('outer')\n",
    ">>> print(LM.geometry, LM.nplies)\n",
    "<Geometry object (0-[200,100]-800)>, 5\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>LM.insert((1, 1), 50)\n",
    ">>>LM.remove(0)\n",
    ">>> print(LM.geometry, LM.nplies)\n",
    "<Geometry object (0-[200,50,100]-0)>, 6\n",
    ">>>LM.remove('inner_i')\n",
    ">>> print(LM.geometry, LM.nplies)\n",
    "<Geometry object (0-[0]-0)>, 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
