    "\n",
    "Reproducible enviroments are important when dependencies conflict with the package due to bugged patches or API changes occuring upstream among sub-dependencies.  In addition to the Develop-Release Cycle Workflow, LamAna endorses both \"hands-off\" and \"hands-on\" options for installing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands-off Approach: unpinned\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, LamAna (and most Pythonic packages) assume that dependencies are coded with minimal API changes that intentionally break code.  With this in mind, users can simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install lamana\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command searches for dependencies in the `install_requires` key of the `setup.py` file.  Dependencies are intentionally \"unpinned\" here, which means a user will (usually) download the latest version of every dependency listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands-on Approach: pinned\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with unpinned dependencies is updates can break a package.  You can protect against such unpredictable changes by pinning dependencies.  In such a case that a dependency fails to install, the user rely on a few **pinned** alternatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install from `conda` (recommended)\n",
    "\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "$ conda install numpy pandas matplotlib  \n",
    "$ pip install lamana  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes installing from source is slow.  You can force the latter installation method to install with faster binaries. \n",

    "$ pip install lamana --use-wheel            # binary  \n",

    "\n",
    "Acquire the file by downloading from the release version on GitHub website.  Locating this file is not hard.  Each release is shipped with this a requirements.txt file.  The file simply needs to be download from the archives of the correct version of lamana hosted at [GitHub releases](https://github.com/par2/lamana/releases) or search on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). Extract the file to your computer and run the commands. \n",
