    "The purpose of the `Stack` class is to build a skeletal, precusor of a primitive `Laminate` object.  This class houses methods for parsing `Geometry` objects into ordered layers, adding materials labels for each layer and setting *expected* stress states for each tensile or compressive side.  `Stack` returns a tuple containing stack-related information (described below).\n",
