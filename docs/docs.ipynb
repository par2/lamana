    "\n",
    "This section is related to maintainers of the project repository.  Documentation for the LamAna package uses [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/), [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/), the [nbsphinx](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.org/en/0.2.2/) extension and conda to make builds. These three tools yield a simple documentating experience by directly rendering jupyter notebooks quickly.  Some details are written here for reference.\n",

    "### Setup\n",

The `conf.py`, and `make` files are Sphinx files and shortcuts respectively.  The remaining files are documents that are actively edited.  \n",

    "### Building with conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Building with large dependencies (numpy, pandas, matplotlib )can take a long time using `pip`.  Exceeding the build time limit (900 seconds) can cause builds to fail.  Therefore, we [build with conda](http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conda.html), which dramatically improves the build speed.  We begin with placing the mentioned yaml files in the appropriate locations.  Here are examples of each file:\n",

    "### Using `nbsphinx`\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks dwell in the \"docs\" folder.  By adding the `nbsphinx` extension to `conf.py`, notebooks extant in this folder are automatically converted to html from ipynb files by running the `make html` build command.  This setup has several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit notebooks directly; no copies or moves required from twin files.\n",
    "2. Notebooks are rendered as-is.\n",
    "3. Timestamps and command line info can be \"hidden\" prior to rendering (edit the metadata).\n",
    "4. Images can pull from a single directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the index.rst file uses the native reST format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Images for the entire package reside in the `./docs/_images` folder.  This placement eases root access to images for any notebook.  There is an \"_archive\" folder used  to store older versions of image files.  The README in the docs folder reminds us not to enumerate updated image files, otherwise notebook links will break. Rather, copy and enumerate the old file and archive for reference."
