Some variables are calculated by the designated laminate theory model, which provide constants for remaining calculations (global_vars).

Toredue redundancy, these constants are thus removed from the DataFrame but stored internally within a `dict`.   The details of this stored are coded within  a model module.

In contrast, Inline values alter directly with the dimensional values thoroughout the lamainate thickness. Names of common variables used in `distributions` are organized below:\n",

    "### The Laminate Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will describe in greater detail how `LaminateModel`s are constructed.  When the user calls `case.apply()`, a series of objects are created.  We begin with a primitive `Stack`, which comprises skeletal components for building a Laminate DataFrame (also called an LFrame).  The phases for building a `LaminateModel` object are outlined below and structure the architexture of `constructs.Laminate` class.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Phase 2: calculate Laminate dimensional values (LFrame)\n",
    "- Phase 3: calculate laminate theory Model values (LMFrame aka `LaminateModel`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First: The `Stack` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the `Stack` class is to build a skeletal, precusor of a primitive laminate object.  This class houses methods for parsing Geometry objects, ordering layers, adding materials labels for each layer and setting expected stress states for each tensile or compressive side.  `Stack` returns a namedtuple containing stack-related information (described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given `Geometry` object  instance (typically assigned to a \"G\" somewhere) the `constructs.Stack(G).StackTuple` method  creates a namedtuple of the stack information.  This object contains attributes to access the stack `order`, the number of plies (`nplies`), the technical `name` for the laminate, and a convenient `alias` if any.  The stack is a dict of the laminate layers ordered from bottom to top.  Now although dicts are unsorted, each layer is enumerated and stored as keys to retain the order, which preserves layer thickness and layer type (sometimes referred as \"ltyype\").  \n",
    "\n",

    "Example\n",
    "=======\n",
    ">>> import LamAna as la\n",

    "<Geometry object (400-[200]-800)>\n",
    ">>> st = constructs.Stack(G).StackTuple    # converts G to a namedtuple\n",

    "More information can be found in the `Stack` class docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second: The `Laminate` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Laminate` class simply builds a `LaminateModel` - an object containing all dimensional information of a physical `Laminate` **and** all theoretical calculations using a laminate theory `Model`, e.g. stress/strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Laminate` class builds an object based on the skeletal layout of a stack parsed by and returned from the `Stack` class.  A `Geometry` object, material parameters and geometric parameters are all passed from the user in as a single  `FeatureInput` object - a dict of useful information that is passed between modules.  See *More on `FeatureInput`* for details.  Stack information is stored in an instance attribute called `Laminate.Snapshot` and then converted to a set of DataFrames.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The IDs and dimensional data are determined and computed by `Stack` and `Laminate`.  Combined, this information builds an LFrame.  `Laminate` then calls the `theories` module which \"handshakes\" between the `Laminate` module and the custom module containing code of a user-specified, theoretical LT model.  (The \"Model\" is typically named auther after the author, sufixed by \"`_LT`\").   These computations update the Laminate DataFrame (`Laminate.LFrame`), creating a final LaminateModel (`Laminate.LMFrame`).  The workflow looks like the following.\n",

    "#### More on `Laminate`\n",

    "- Lamina - *singular* a single laminate layer\n",
    "- Laminae - *plural* multiple laminate layers\n",
    "- Laminate - a structure comprising stacked laminae\n",
    "\n",
    "A lamina is essentially a layer from a `Stack` with `p` number of DataFrame rows.  These rows represent points within a lamina that reflect inline calculations detemined in laminate theory, e.g. stress or strain.  Laminae have either **unbound interfaces** (exposed surfaces), or **bound interfaces**, proximal to an adjacent lamina.  For example, outer layers have one bound and one unbound interface, while inner layers have two bound interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~OuterLayer and InnerLayer are subclasses of Laminate.  They are unique because their stress states are must be determined by their position in the Laminate stack order.  This stress `side` is passed in through `Laminate.buid.rebuild(*args)`. MiddleLayer is also subclassed from Laminae, but instances assign stress sides differently.~~  \"None\" is assigned to rows pertaining to neutral axes where the stress is neither compressive or tensile.  Moreover, it is not possible to differentiate a single row into tensile (\"Tens.\") and compressive (\"Comp.\") sides.  For such indeterminate rows, the value \"INDET\" is assigned; these apply to odd plies with p = 1.  For p > 1, MiddleLayer has both tensile and compressive stress states.  ~~For this reason, Laminate.set_stresses() is called separately of MiddleLayer.  This issues is discussed further in *More on `label_`*~~\n",

    "#### More on `FeatureInput`\n",
    "\n",
    "A Feature module defines a `FeatureInput` object. For `distributions`, it is defined in `Case`. `FeatureInput`s contain information that is passed between objects.  For instance, this object transfers user input data in `distributions` (converted in `input_`) to the `constructs` module to build the laminate stack and populate ID and dimensional columns. A FeatureInput from `distributions` looks like the following (as of 0.4.4b).\n",

    "We transverse the absolute height of the laminate at different cross-sectional planes.  The values of inline stress points are calculated along different planes throughout the laminate thickness. What happens at interfaces where two materials meet with different stresses?  How are these two stress points differentiated in a DataFrame or in a plot?  For plotting purposes, we need to define diferent types of points.  Here we define some rulse and four types of points found within a (i.e. DataFrame rows):\n",

    "4. neutralaxis - the middle, symmetric axial plane\n",
    "\n",
    "How these points are distributed depends on their locations within each lamina and whether they are located on the tensile or compressive `side_`.  ~~InnerLayer and OuterLayer acquire stress information from the stack (see `Stack.stack_to_df`) since the points are mirrored across the neutral axis.~~  The neutral axis exists in physical laminates, but they are only represented as a row in DataFrames of odd ply, odd p laminates.  ~~Since the MiddleLayer must always intersect the position of the neutral axis, its construction is more predictable.  Thus MiddleLayer uses `Laminate.set_stress()` independently to distribute points.~~  The image below differentiates between grups of point found in middle layers and any other layer with respect to `k_`.\n",

    "### `LaminateModel` Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "An illustration of LaminateModel handling is shown below.  The `Laminate` DataFrame (LFrame) is passed from `constructs` to `theories`.  If successful the `LaminateModel` is returned to `constructs`; otherwise the `Laminate` is returned unchanged (LFrame).  \n",

    "\n",
    "When `Laminate._update_columns._update_calculations()` is called, an instance of `self` (x) is passed to `theories.handshake()` (black arrow).  This function handles all updates to the primitive `Laminate` DataFrame (LFrame) which comprise IDs and Dimensional columns only.  `self` gives the model's author full access to Laminate attributes.  From here, `theories.handshakes()` searches within the models directory for a model (grey, dashed arrow) specified by the user at the time of instantiation, i.e. `Case.apply(*args, model=<model_name>).` \n",
    "\n",
    "A model is simply a module containing code that handles Laminate Theory calculations.  The purpose of the model is to update the primitive DataFame with LT calculations.  `handshake()` distinguishes whether the author implemented a class-style or function-style model.  \n",

    "The **most important hook method/function is `_use_model_()`**, which must be present somewhere in the model module and must return a tuple containing:\n",
    "    - the updated Laminate DataFrame with model data columns (a.k.a. `LaminateModel`)\n",
    "    - the `FeatureInput` with updated 'Globals' key - a dict of calculated constants, used in exported reports (see output_ section). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `Laminate.LMFrame` attribute is updated with the new `LaminateModel` DataFrame (green arrow).  However, if exceptions are raised, `Laminate._update_calculations()` handles reverting the LMFrame to a copy of LFrame, printing a warning and minor traceback informing the author to refactor the code.  This is commom for Laminates with p=1, which detects an INDET in middle layers and must revert to LFrame.   See Exceptions for more details.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful, extensible option of the `LamAna` package is user implementation of their own laminate theory models.  A library of these custom models (as well as the defaults) are kept in the `models` directory (sub-package).  This is possbile since the `theories` module handshakes between the `constructs` module and the selected model from the `models` sub-package.  All models related exceptions and global model code is housed in `theories` and merges the model calculations to generate data variables in the `LaminateModel` object.  "
