The LamAna project is an extensible Python library for interactive laminate analysis and visualization.

.. sidebar:: What's New in LamAna

   - appveyor builds (support on Windows)

LamAna enables users to **calculate**/**export**/**analyze** and
**author** custom models based on laminate theory.  *Feature modules*  can be
used to plot stress distributions, analyze thickessness effects and
predict failure trends.


**User Benefits**

The primary benefits to users is an scientific package that:

-  **Simplicity**: given a model and parameters, analysis begins with
   three lines of code
-  **Visualization**: plotting and physical representations
-  **Analysis**: fast computational analysis using a Pandas backend
-  **Extensibility**: anyone with a little Python knowledge can
   implement custom laminate models
-  **Speed**: data computed, plotting and exported for dozens of
   configurations within seconds


**Community Benefits**

Long-term goals for the laminate community are:

-  **Standardization**: general abstractions for laminate theory
   analysis
-  **Common Library**: R-like acceptance of model contributions for
   everyone to use
